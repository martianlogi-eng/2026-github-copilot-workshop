# Copilot Instructions for This Workshop

## Objective
Build a procurement management system with core modules for Purchase Requisition (PR), Purchase Order (PO), and Goods Receipt (GR).
A procurement system manages how a company buys things, with control and traceability from request to receiving.

The modules for a MVP (minimum viable product) procurement system include:
- **Purchase Requisition (PR)**: Employees request items/services, which are reviewed and approved by managers.
- **Purchase Order (PO)**: Approved requisitions are converted into purchase orders sent to suppliers, tracking order details and status.
- **Goods Receipt (GR)**: When items are delivered, a goods receipt is created to confirm what was received, update inventory, and trigger payment.

In this workshop, we focus on using a prebuilt baseline and a add a backlog sprint.

Reference plan: `docs/plan.md`.

## Scope Constraints (Strict)
- Baseline provided in repo: database schema + Home/Dashboard + PR module (list/create/detail + required PR APIs).
- Participant implementation scope: PO module only (PO list/create/detail + PO APIs + PO validations).
- GR module is out of implementation scope during the workshop and treated as further exploration.
- Keep business scope minimal and teachable.
- Avoid enterprise-only features (SSO, workflow engine, reporting, notifications, advanced compliance).
- Prefer clarity and small modules over abstraction-heavy architecture.

## Technology Decisions (Do Not Change)
- Backend: Fastify + JavaScript
- API style: REST JSON
- Database: PostgreSQL (Docker local)
- Frontend: Vue 3 + Vite + JavaScript
- Unit test: Jest
- E2E test: Playwright
- Do not use Prisma.

## API Requirements
- Maintain compatibility with endpoints listed in `docs/plan.md`.
- For participant backlog, prioritize PO endpoints:
	- `POST /api/purchase-orders`
	- `POST /api/purchase-orders/:id/submit`
	- `GET /api/purchase-orders/:id`
	- `GET /api/purchase-orders/:id/open-lines`
- Enforce PO rule: allocation qty <= PR line remaining qty.
- GR endpoints/rules can be left untouched during workshop implementation.

## Code Style Guidance
- Keep files short and readable for workshop participants.
- Use explicit naming; avoid clever patterns.
- Include basic request validation and clear error responses.
- Favor service functions for business rules and thin route handlers.

## Testing Expectations
- Add focused Jest tests for PO business validations (especially over-allocation and status transition).
- Add Playwright coverage focused on PO pages/flow integrated with existing baseline PR data.
- Do not over-invest in test framework complexity.

## Implementation Quality Checklist
- [ ] Scope respected: changes stay within PO module goals for this workshop.
- [ ] API compatibility preserved with `docs/plan.md` contract.
- [ ] Business rules enforced in services (especially allocation qty <= PR line remaining qty).
- [ ] Route handlers remain thin with clear validation and readable error responses.
- [ ] Naming is explicit and file/module size stays teachable.

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Unit tests cover happy path and failure cases for PO validations.
- [ ] Unit tests include status transition rules (draft -> submitted and invalid transitions).
- [ ] E2E flow covers PO list/create/detail against seeded PR data.
- [ ] Changed tests and relevant suites pass locally before completion.

## Documentation Discipline Checklist
- [ ] Any new endpoint behavior is reflected in `docs/plan.md` or noted in PR description.
- [ ] Assumptions and constraints are documented briefly (what was simplified for workshop clarity).
- [ ] Error cases exposed to users are documented in code comments or route-level notes.
- [ ] Change summary includes what was implemented, what was intentionally out of scope, and why.

## User Interface Guidelines
- Follow the existing UI patterns established in the baseline for consistency.
- Always respect the CSS variables set in the baseline for colors, spacing, and typography.
- Never use emojis in the UI or commit messages. Create a custom SVG icon if needed for visual emphasis.

## Optional Extension
- Bookmark feature (PR|PO|GR) is an optional post-backlog exercise and should be driven via GitHub Issue creation workflow.

## Workshop-First Principle
When there is a trade-off between production robustness and workshop clarity, choose workshop clarity.

# RTK — Token-Optimized CLI

rtk is a CLI proxy that filters and compresses command outputs, saving 60-90% tokens.

#### Rule

Always prefix shell commands with rtk:

# Instead of:      Use:
git status         rtk git status
git log -10        rtk git log -10
docker ps          rtk docker ps
Other examples where you can use rtk:

rtk tree
rtk ls -la
rtk read
rtk grep
rtk rg
rtk npm run test
rtk curl <url>

## Codebase Context & Knowledge Graph Protocol

You have access to a pre-computed AST knowledge graph of this repository at `graphify-out/graph.json`. To minimize context window clutter, prevent hallucinations, and accurately map cross-file dependencies, you MUST follow these routing rules:

1. **Consult the Graph First:** Before writing plans, making sweeping structural modifications, or tracing function call blast-radii, read `graphify-out/graph.json`. Filter nodes to only those whose `id` paths start with `backend/` or `frontend/src/` — nodes from `playwright-report/`, `test-results/`, and `coverage/` are minified build artifacts and must be ignored.
2. **Identify God Nodes:** Rank nodes by edge degree. The highest-degree nodes are the structural hubs (e.g., service files, route registries). Avoid duplicating responsibilities already owned by a god node.
3. **Trace Structural Paths:** If the user asks about relationships between modules or layers (e.g., how the API layer reaches the DB), do not grep blindly. Traverse the `links` array in `graph.json` to find the actual dependency path.
4. **Graph State:** The graph is derived strictly via AST extraction — no documentation or semantic layer. Treat all node hierarchies and import edges as 100% extracted truth (`EXTRACTED` confidence tier). Do not infer structure that isn't in the graph.

Prerequisites:
- tree (https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/tree)
- rtk (https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk)
- Graphify (https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify)
- ast-grep (https://github.com/ast-grep/ast-grep)
-->

## Response Style
- Be extremely concise. No pleasantries, no filler.
- When asked to write code, return code only unless explanation is explicitly requested.
- No sycophantic preambles ("Sure!", "Great question!", "Absolutely!").
- No "Here's a function that..." preambles.
- Don't restate the question before answering.
- No "Note:", "Tip:", or "Remember:" appendices unless asked.
- No usage examples unless asked.
- No unsolicited suggestions or improvements beyond what was asked.
- Use short variable names where meaning is clear from context.

<!-- example for JavaScript -->
## Code Style
- JavaScript (ES2022+), no TypeScript unless specified
- Arrow functions, const over let
- Minimal inline comments — only for genuinely complex logic


## Context Retrieval Policy

Always retrieve the smallest amount of information necessary.
Escalate only when necessary. Stop escalating as soon as sufficient information has been obtained.

Preferred order:
1. Need code structure? `graphify-out/graph.json`.
2. Need directory structure? `rtk tree`
3. Need symbols? `ast-grep`.
4. Need implementation? Source files.
5. Use repository-wide search as last resort

Avoid reading entire directories or the whole repository unless explicitly requested.

## RTK (Rust Token Killer) - Token-Optimized CLI

`rtk` is a CLI proxy that filters and compresses command outputs, saving 60-90% tokens.

**Always** prefix commands with `rtk`. If RTK has a dedicated filter, it uses it. If not, it passes through unchanged. This means RTK is always safe to use.


Instead of:
```
ls -la .
git status
git log -10
docker ps
```

Use:
```
rtk ls -la .
rtk git status
rtk git log -10
rtk docker ps
```

### RTK commands example

```bash
rtk ls <path>
rtk read <file>
rtk find <pattern>

rtk err <cmd>           # Filter errors only from any command
rtk log <file>          # Deduplicated logs with counts
rtk json <file>         # JSON structure without values

rtk curl <url>          # Compact HTTP responses

rtk docker ps           # Compact container list
rtk docker images       # Compact image list
rtk docker logs <c>     # Deduplicated logs
```

## Graphify - Codebase context & knowledge graph protocol

A pre-computed AST knowledge graph (`graph.json`) is available at: `graphify-out/graph.json`
Use `graph.json` before searching or reading multiple source files.

Workflow:
1. Read `graph.json`.
2. Identify the relevant symbols, files, and dependency paths.
3. Read only the source files required for the task.
4. Avoid scanning unrelated files.

Use the graph for:
- dependency tracing
- call-path discovery
- identifying high-centrality modules
- impact analysis before refactoring
- locating symbol definitions

Never read an entire directory simply to locate a symbol. Use `graph.json` to locate the symbol first, then read only the relevant files.

The graph is generated from AST extraction and represents extracted structural relationships only. Treat graph edges as authoritative for structural relationships.
Do not infer dependencies that are absent from the graph.


## ast-grep

Prefer `ast-grep` over `grep` whenever searching source code.

Use `ast-grep` for:
- locating function definitions
- locating class definitions
- locating method implementations
- finding imports
- matching AST patterns
- performing structural search

Use `grep` only for:
- Markdown
- JSON
- YAML
- log files
- generated text
- plain-text configuration

Avoid using `grep` to search programming language source code when `ast-grep` can answer the query.
